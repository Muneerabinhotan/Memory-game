## How The Game Works

* The game board consists of sixteen cards and ranged randomly on the grid with hidden symbols in every card. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side.

* The rules of the game are very simple: open two hidden cards at a time to match them together.

Each turn:

* The player opens one card to reveal its symbol.
* The player then opens the second card, trying to looking for the same symbol of the first card to match them together and the counter will count each two cards move.
* If the cards matched, both cards stay open.
* If the cards do not matched, they close again.

The stars rating depends on the number of moves:
* three stars If the moves  are 9 or less.
* two stars If the moves  are between 10 and 19.
* one star If the moves  are  20 or more.

The game ends once all the cards are matched.
The player can restart the game at any time if they want by clicking on the restart icon.
